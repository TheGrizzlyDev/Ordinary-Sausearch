# Ordinary Sausearch
Ordinary Sausearch is a 'search engine' for ordinary sausages. It allows you to search by name, sausage score or ruffalo score, share your searches and even download them as JSON or CSV for your sausage science project.

## How to contribute
You can contribute by:
- Submitting a PR, don't worry too much about it, if the code needs to be improved we can help you do that. At the end of the day this isn't the most mission critical app ever...
- Testing and sending us bug reports, this app has been written in a rush and without too much care, it most likely has enough issues to make a bugs sausage.
In both cases, head over to https://github.com/TheGrizzlyDev/Ordinary-Sausearch/issues to either find or submit issues.
